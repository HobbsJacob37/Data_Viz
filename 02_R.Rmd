## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


I just left the above, it is what prints whenever you start a Rmd file.  I find it useful to ready once in your life.  Don't include it on your projects please!

I am going to run through everything I did in python in 01_Python but this time in R.  I think you'll find some things easier and others much harder.  I still haven't decided which language I preffere as they both have their place.

First you should notice that it is a little more challenging to get RStudio going.  That is a serious problem for students.  I also find the coding a little clunkier than python especially for the basics (for loops, function defining).  R is much better at statistics and the tidyverse is a killer library for data munging and vizualization.

## Our Data

```{r}
df <- read.csv('https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine/wine.data',header = F)
cols <- c('Class','Alcohol','MalicAcid','Ash','AlcalinityAsh','Magnesium','Phenols','Flavanoids','NonflavanoidPhenols','Proanthocyanins','ColorIntensity','Hue','OD280/OD315','Proline')

colnames(df) <- cols
df %>% head
```
There is one issue I'll fix here.  R is interpreting 'Class' as `int`.  I want it to be a factor.  Here I am using the tidyverse!
```{r}
df <- df %>% mutate(Class = as.factor(Class))
```

Okay, on to vizulaizations!

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = Class)) +
  geom_bar()
```

Or in base R

```{r}
barplot(table(df$Class))
```

BTW, `table` is a sweet command that I totally tried to use in python...

```{r}
pie(table(df$Class))
```

MMMM, pie!


### Quantitative Data

I'll move through these quickly, keep in mind base R does not have many options but ggplot does!

```{r}
hist(df$Alcohol)
```

```{r}
boxplot(df$Alcohol)
```

```{r}
plot(df$Alcohol,df$Ash)
```

Let's get to ggplot and talk about how it works.  You chain together multiple commands using the `+` this allows you to do a bunch without nesting parentheses!  You call ggplot, give it data, then aes will define the aesthetics for the rest of the graph.  This alone won't do anything, then you'll have to call what kind of graph.  After that you can add loads more!
```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = Alcohol, y = Ash, color = Class))+
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(y = Flavanoids, color = Class)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
pivot_longer(df[c('Class','Flavanoids','Hue')],cols = c('Flavanoids','Hue')) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = name, y = value, color = Class)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
summary(df$Alcohol)
```

```{r}
mean(df$Alcohol)
```

```{r}
sd(df$Alcohol)
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(Class) %>%
  summarise(Hue = mean(Hue), Flavanoids = mean(Flavanoids))
```

## Your Turn

1. Create a new Rmd notebook.  Title and put your name on your document
2. Load Libraries
3. Gather the iris dataset and load it into your notebook.  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nurfnick/Data_Viz/main/iris.csv
4. Examine the dataset.
5. Create a boxplot of the categorical variable
5. Create visualizations of your favorite variable
  1. Histogram
  2. Box Plot
  3. Violin
7. Compute statistics accompanying the visualizations created
8. Save your notebook and knitted html to GitHub and share the link in the blackboard assignment
